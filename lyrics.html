         <pre>
            All to Jesus I surrender,
            All to Him I freely give;
            I will ever love and trust Him,
            In His presence daily live.<br>
            I surrender all,
            I surrender all.
            All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
            I surrender all.<br>
            All to Jesus I surrender,
            Humbly at His feet I bow,
            Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
            Take me, Jesus, take me now.<br>
            All to Jesus I surrender,
            Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
            Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
            Truly know that Thou art mine.<br>
            All to Jesus I surrender,
            Lord, I give myself to Thee;
            Fill me with Thy love and power,
            Let Thy blessing fall on me.<br>
            All to Jesus I surrender,
            Oh, the joy of full salvation!
            Glory, glory to His name!
